Warranty disclaimers
Spotify will provide the Spotify Service using reasonable care and skill and in accordance with any specification of the Spotify Service provided by Spotify, however, subject to that, the Spotify Service is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. Further, Spotify and all owners of the content disclaim any express, implied, and statutory warranties regarding the content, including warranties of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Neither Spotify nor any owner of content warrants that the Spotify Service or content is free of malware or other harmful components. In addition, Spotify makes no representation regarding, nor does it warrant or assume any responsibility for, any third-party applications (or the content thereof), user content, devices or any product or service advertised, promoted or offered by a third party on or through the Spotify Service or any hyperlinked website, and Spotify is not responsible for any transactions between you and any third-party providers of the foregoing.

While accessing the Spotify Service, you may have access to explicit content filtering features, but use of these features may still result in some explicit content being served and you should not rely on such features to filter all explicit content. Content may be directly updated/uploaded on the Spotify Service by a third party and therefore we make no warranty that you will not come across content that might not suit your sensibilities and might be considered inappropriate by you. In such a scenario, you are free to discontinue or opt not to view/stream/consume such content. This section applies to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the exclusion and limitations in this section may not apply to you and nothing will affect your statutory rights.
